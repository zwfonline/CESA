            The annual conference of the Chinese Economics Society Australia (CESA) aims to attract worldwide scholars interested in addressing significant issues related to the Chinese economy and evaluating the impacts of China’s development on the global economy. The 34th Annual CESA Conference, jointly hosted by the University of South Australia and The University of Adelaide, provides a platform for discussing China’s development and its implications. 

            Over the past few decades, China has ascended as a prominent economic force, providing abundant business prospects for both developing and developed economies due to its rapid economic development and increasing global influence. China’s recent development trajectory underscores a shift towards a more sustainable and innovation-driven growth model. Prioritizing private enterprise development, technological advancements, environmental protection, and social well-being, China aims to enhance the overall quality of economic growth rather than mere GDP expansion. It is imperative to understand this new development focus and its potential implications for the Chinese and world economies. We invite scholars from Australia, China, and other countries to contribute and present research that advances our comprehension of China’s past success, lessons learned, and future directions at the 34th CESA annual conference.
